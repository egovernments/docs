      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>In the earlier versions, the SLA can be configured only at the business
          service level. Now it has been enhanced in a way that either the SLA can
          be configured at a business service level for a business service or it
          can be configured at each workflow state in the business service.</p>
        <p>If a business service has 3 workflow states A-B-C , now there can be an
          SLA definition for application movement from A to B and one a separate
          definition for movement from B-C</p>

        </ul>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Either if the SLA breach is at the business service level or at the workflow
          state level, the application can be configured to move the application
          from an existing state to a role.</p>
        <p>For Example: If the config is in breach of SLA move the application to
          the Field inspector role, then the application will be moved automatically
          to the role field inspector when the SLA timeline is reached.</p>

      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>On breach of an SLA either at the business service level or at the workflow
          state level, it can be configured to make the application deemed approved
          or rejected.</p>
        <p>Deemed reject will come in use cases where citizen fails to take any action</p>
        <p>Deemed approval will come in use cases where employees fail to take action
          within the stipulated SLA</p>

        <p>On breach of SLA in a workflow state, it can be configured to move the
          application to the next logical stage in the workflow ladder.</p>
        <p>For example: if the flow of the application is from A-B-C, now in step
          B if there is a breach in SLA, automatically the application will be moved
          to step C.</p>
