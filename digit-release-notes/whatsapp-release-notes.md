      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>Call to action buttons (CTA) is an interactive message template that aims
          to provide improved conversational experience. For WhatsApp V2, certain
          end points have call to action buttons included.</p>
        <p>Instead of citizens typing for a reply, CTA buttons allow citizens to
          select the option and perform an action instantly. The CTAs are applicable
          on the following scenarios :</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pay Bills.</li>
          <li>Return to Main Menu.</li>
          <li>View Payment Receipts.</li>

        <p>As part of the WhatsApp V2, citizens :</p>
        <ol>
          <li>whose mobile numbers are not linked with DIGIT.</li>
          <li>are aware about the account details (PT ID/ Connection No).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>can now search and pay the outstanding bills.</p>
        <p>This feature encourages citizens to have access of outstanding bills on
          DIGIT even if the mobile number is not registered on the platform.</p>

        </ol>
        <p>can now use the open search and pay the outstanding bills.</p>
        <p>The open search allows citizens to fetch outstanding bills using other
          parameters (like door no/ name etc). In this case the citizens will be
          redirected to the open search webpage and all the further interactions
          are exclusive of WhatsApp Chatbot.</p>
        <p>This feature encourages citizens to have an access gateway to pay outstanding
          bills even when the required details are unknown.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Only linked mobile numbers are allowed to download the past payment receipts.</li>
          <li>Non-Linked Mobile numbers cannot access the receipts and only have provision

        </ul>
        <p>while filing a complaint on PGR.</p>
        <p>This feature is a major enhancement to the older version as now citizens
          don&apos;t have to be redirected outside the chatbot to select details.</p>
        <p>Instead citizens can now type and submit the information. Even when the
          information entered is incorrect, the NLP engine provides a suggestion
          for citizens to make corrections and proceed.</p>
