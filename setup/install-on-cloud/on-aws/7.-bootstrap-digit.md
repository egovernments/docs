# 7. Bootstrap DIGIT

Post-deployment, now the application is accessible from the configured domain.

To try out  employee login, Lets create a sample tenant, city, user to login and assign LME employee role through the seed script

1. We have to do the [kubectl port-forwarding](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/kubectl-port-forward) of the **egov-user** service running from Kubernetes cluster to your localhost, this will now give you access to egov-user service directly and interact with the API directly.

```
kubectl port-forward svc/egov-user 8080:8080 -n egov
Output:
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080
```

2\. Seed the sample data

* Ensure you have the postman to run the following seed data API, if not [Install postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/canary/) on your local
* Import the following postman collection into the postman and run it, this will have the seed data that enable sample test users and localization data.
  * [DIGIT Bootstrap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egovernments/DIGIT-DevOps/quickstart/deploy-as-code/bootstrap\_scripts/seed\_data.json)

To test the Kubernetes operations through kubectl from your local machine, please execute the below commands.

```bash
#get the pods running in the cluster
kubectl get pods -n egov

Output:

You have successfully completed the DIGIT Infra, Deployment setup and Installed a DIGIT - PGR module.

#### Use the below link in browser

```
digit.try.com/employee
```

Use the below credentials to login into the complaint section

&#x20;     Username: GRO

&#x20;     Password: eGov@4321

&#x20;     City:           CITYA



## DIGIT Deployment - Assessment

By now we have successfully completed the digit setup on cloud, use the URL that you mentioned in your env.yaml Eg: https://mysetup.digit.org and create a grievance to ensure the PGR module deployed is working fine. Refer the below product documentation for the steps.

**Credentials:**

1. Citizen: You can use your default mobile number (9999999999) to sign in using the default Mobile OTP 123456.
2. Employee: Username: **GRO** and password: **eGov@4321**

{% content-ref url="../../../product/modules/public-grievances-and-redressal/pgr-user-manual/" %}
[pgr-user-manual](../../../product/modules/public-grievances-and-redressal/pgr-user-manual/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Post grievance creation and assignment of the same to LME, capture the screenshot of the same and share it to ensure your setup is working fine.

## Destroy the Cluster

Post validating the PGR functionality share the API response of the following request to assess the correctness of successful DIGIT PGR Deployment.

Finally, cleanup the DIGIT Setup if you wish, using the following command. This will delete the entire cluster and other cloud resources that were provisioned for the DIGIT Setup.

```
cd DIGIT-DevOps/infra-as-code/terraform/my-digit-eks
terraform destroy
```

## Conclusion

All Done, we have successfully Created infra on Cloud, Deployed Digit, Bootstrapped DIGIT, Performed a Transaction on PGR and finally destroyed the cluster.
