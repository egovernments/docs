# 1. Pre-requisites

The [**Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html) is one of the AWS services for deploying, managing and scaling any distributed and containerized workloads, here we can provision the EKS cluster on AWS from the ground up using [**terraform**](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html) **(**infra-as-code) and then deploy the DIGIT platform services as config-as-code using [**Helm**](https://helm.sh/docs/).

## Pre-reads

* Know about EKS: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsUnPWp5ilc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsUnPWp5ilc)
* Know what is terraform: [https://youtu.be/h970ZBgKINg](https://youtu.be/h970ZBgKINg)

## Prerequisites <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites"></a>

1. [**AWS account**](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h\_ct\&src=default\&redirect\_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start) with the admin access to provision EKS Service, you can always subscribe to free AWS account to learn the basics and try, but there is a limit to [**what is offered as free**](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), for this demo you need to have a commercial subscription to the EKS service, if you want to try out for a day or two, it might cost you about Rs 500 - 1000.&#x20;
   1. **Note**: Post the Demo, for the eGov internal folks, you can request for the AWS access for 4 hrs time bound access to eGov's training AWS account upon on the request and available number of slots per day)
2. Install [**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) on your local machine that helps you interact with the kubernetes cluster
3. Install [**Helm**](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) that helps you package the services along with the configurations, envs, secrets, etc into a [**kubernetes manifests**](https://devspace.cloud/docs/cli/deployment/kubernetes-manifests/what-are-manifests)
4. Install [**terraform**](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.10/) version (0.14.10) for the Infra-as-code (IaC) to provision cloud resources as code and with desired resource graph and also it helps to destroy the cluster at one go.
   1. If you already have a different version of the terraform version running install [tfswitch](https://github.com/warrensbox/terraform-switcher) that would allow you to have multiple terraform version in the same machine and toggle between the desired versions.
5. Setup AWS Account
