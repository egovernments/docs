# BPA Service Setup and Configuration

### **Software to install**

* Java 1.8
* Eclipse
* Postgres
* PhpPgAdmin
* Postman \(Application\)
* Respective Git MiddleWare
* Kubectl
* Kafka

Take the code pull from the git:

Need to consider 2 repositories for code to run locally

1. Municipal services - where our BPA code exists and some dependency services also available here [ ![](https://github.githubassets.com/favicon.ico)https://github.com/egovernments/municipal-services.git - Connect to preview](https://github.com/egovernments/municipal-services.git)
2. Core Services - Where dependency services exist to run our code locally [![](https://github.githubassets.com/favicon.ico)https://github.com/egovernments/core-services.git - Connect to preview](https://github.com/egovernments/core-services.git)

Import the required projects to eclipse

From municipal-services import bpa-services, bpa-calculator and land-services.  
From core-services import user service, idgen service, mdms service, location service, localization service, workflow service, egov-persister.

Before running the application make sure the following setups are complete to ensure the application runs smoothly.

* kafka set up in your system which is running fine.  Download the latest version of kafka from here.  [https://kafka.apache.org/downloads](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads)

Run the below commands based on your system types

**For linux:  in kafka folder path**

**Example:**  D:\kafka\_2.13-2.4.0

&gt; bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties  
&gt; bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

**Ref:** [**https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart**](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart)

**For Windows: in windows path**

**Example:** D:\kafka\_2.13-2.4.0\bin\windows  
start zookeeper-server-start.bat ..\..\config\zookeeper.properties  
start kafka-server-start.bat ..\..\config\server.properties

* And lombok setup for eclipse **For ref:** [**https://www.journaldev.com/18124/java-project-lombok**](https://www.journaldev.com/18124/java-project-lombok)
* Kubectl setup based on the requirement **To get the pods:** kubectl get pods **To port forward:** kubectl port-forward &lt;&lt;pod name&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;port number&gt;&gt;:8080 **To get the logs:** kubectl get logs

After all the setups are done successfully, try to run the application locally.  
  
BPA-Services How to run the application in local:  
  
Check the services which are connected to local and which are connected to dev

* Which are connected to dev no need to change anything.
* If it is connected to local check the services are in below list _**IDGEN –** can run locally or can point to dev from cmd prompt_ _**PERSISTER –** can run locally_ _**MDMS –** can directly point to dev or can run in local_ _**LOCATION –** can directly point to dev_ _**WORKFLOW –** can point to dev or can run locally_ _**LOCALIZATIONS** – we can directly point this to dev_ _**USER-SERVICE –** need to point to dev from cmd prompt_ _**LAND-SERVICE –** need to run locally_ _**BPA-CALCULATOR** – can run locally or can point to dev._
* If the changes are from these services follow the below process to run those respective services.

**For core services:**  
  
_**IDGEN:**_

Approach 1: Directly point this to dev from the application.properties in bpa-services  
Approach 2: Point this to local and give the port forward to dev by using kubctl.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: We are not running this service locally.
{% endhint %}

_**PERSISTER:**_ 

U need to run it in local and need to add respective yaml files in persister resource folder which are bpa-persister.yml and egov-workflow-v2-persister.yml and also land-persister.yml

And need to add these in persister application.properties repo path

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Please check whether data is is saving or not in local data base\(DB\).
{% endhint %}

  
_**MDMS:**_  

**to run local:**  
For running this in local need to change in 2 file that is application.properties and MDMSApplicationRunnerImpl

In application.properties need to change the paths for the master-config url as path of master-config.json and for config path as upto pb/bh

In MDMS ApplicationRunnerImpl need to change the data in a function from the path to file.

**to point to dev:**  
Approach 1: Directly point this to dev from the application.properties in bpa-services

Approach 2: Give it as local connection in BPA application.properties and port forward to dev by using kubectl.

**Postman Collection** [https://www.getpostman.com/collections/c59b5c6190719ecd306a](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/c59b5c6190719ecd306a)

_**LOCATION**_ 

Approach 1: Give it a local connection in BPA application.properties and port forward to dev by using kubectl.

Approach 2: Directly point this to dev from the application.properties in bpa-services

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Not tried it in local / may got errors so pointing to dev.
{% endhint %}

**Postman collection** [https://www.getpostman.com/collections/4f6a25a4fb32572af5ff](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/4f6a25a4fb32572af5ff)  


_**WORKFLOW**_

**to point to dev:**  
Approach 1: Directly point this to dev from the application.properties in bpa-services

Approach 2: Give it as local connection in BPA application.properties and port forward to dev by using kubectl.

**to run local:**

can run locally by pointing to the local database, but for this need to create the workflow locally using the workflow create API.  
  
**Postman collection** [https://www.getpostman.com/collections/aa30be8a8b9de4c13aa8](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/aa30be8a8b9de4c13aa8)

_**USER-SERVICE**_  
Approach 1: Give it as local connection in BPA application.properties and port forward to dev by using kubectl.

Approach 2: Directly point this to dev from the application.properties in bpa-services

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:**  In local not able to run the application successfully, so the following dev.
{% endhint %}

**Postman Collection**: [https://www.getpostman.com/collections/60bbd6aed27605dcc270](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/60bbd6aed27605dcc270)  
  
_**LOCALIZATIONS**_

Approach 1: Directly point this to dev from the application.properties in bpa-services

Approach 2: Give it as local connection in BPA application.properties and port forward to dev by using kubectl.  
  
**Postman Collection** [https://www.getpostman.com/collections/12cc4c3855be9699c278](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/12cc4c3855be9699c278)

**to point to dev:**  
Approach 1: Directly point this to dev from the application.properties in bpa-services

_**Land-Service:**_

**to run local:**

can run locally by pointing to the local database.

**to point to dev:**
