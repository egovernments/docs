# Citizen User Manual

## **Citizens** 

Citizens represent individuals, groups, and communities who are the building owners or occupants. The BPA module provides the citizens with the scope to view building permit applications submitted by the stakeholders or architects. They can request the stakeholders to make any changes in the application if required. Citizens approve the applications and make the payment.

**The citizen can -**

1. [Register stakeholders](bpa-citizen-manual.md#register-stakeholders)
2. [View application status](bpa-citizen-manual.md#view-application-status)
3. [Request edits](bpa-citizen-manual.md#request-edits-and-approve-applications)

### **Register Stakeholders**

The citizen user portal allows stakeholders to register themselves on the OBPAS system. Stakeholders constitute architects, builders, engineers, supervisors, or town planners. A unique license number is generated for each stakeholder on the system. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Citizens can have multi-stakeholder access. Hence, a citizen can be registered as an architect, a builder, and a normal citizen.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The registered stakeholder will have state-level access permission to apply for new building permits or occupancy certificates.
{% endhint %}
