# Deduction

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

A deduction master is defined to create a reference between ledger codes and the standard and statutory deductions that are deducted in various creditor bills. By defining this deduction master, the accounts department can process the remittance of all the deductions done for a time period at once and keep track of the same.

An example of a deduction is what is deducted from salary bill as income taxes.
