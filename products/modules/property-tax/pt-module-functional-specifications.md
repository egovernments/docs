# PT Module Functional Specifications

## Introduction

## Functional Scope

The PT product features can be broadly classified as the following modules:

1. Registration, Login and Creation of User Profile
2. Filling an Assessment for a Property
3. Searching for a Property
4. Modifications to a Property

{% endhint %}

### Filing For Property Assessment

With this feature, a citizen and employee can perform a self-assessment of a new property for a financial year. This feature helps in registering the property in the system. The details of the property can be entered online and can be assessed for the calculation of the taxes.

The PT Product is designed in a user friendly manner and reduces chances of error. System calculates the tax automatically and creates the demand. If a user wants to reassess his property due to any reason (for eg, incorrect data, change in property etc), it can be done by editing details of the last assessment.

An employee can edit the details of the last assessment, on behalf of the citizen-based on the owner’s input. Citizen can track down the status of his incomplete assessment. Any incomplete assessment can be searched and completed.

{% hint style="warning" %}

* Mailing & permanent address,
* Built year
* Individual room measurements
* The system computes the property taxes automatically as per process and rules of the state.
* The system has a facility to make entry in system by inspector after site visit and assessment of the same by the superintendent.
* The system supports dynamic calculation for late fees, interest, rebates, etc. as on the day of demand generation.
* The system fetches the data of previous year property data while e-filing for current year so that all the dues are calculated.

{% endhint %}

### Modifications to a Property

The PT system provides the ability to capture mutation and transfer of ownership. It reduces interfaces between the user and the State and thus promote greater transparency. It also helps in reducing the time taken for mutation after registration. The system provides the ability for alteration of assessment after verification and inspection. Any structural changes like addition/extension/reduction of existing built up area or construction type OR utility changes like usage or occupancy have an impact on the increase/decrease in property tax demand. These changes can be handled by the ‘Additional/Alteration of Assessment’ feature.

The System provides the ability for bifurcation/ amalgamation of property. The property bifurcation/ amalgamation undergoes an approval process. The parent property needs to be modified accordingly, which can be done in the system.

{% hint style="warning" %}
* Mutation of property and change of ownership details
* Capture Extension/ Addition and Alteration and reassessment based on changed property details
* Bifurcation of property
* Amalgamation of property
{% endhint %}

### Generate Demand Notice

The system notifies the citizens about the demand through SMS/Email. The generated Bills can also be grouped and printed for physical distribution by the ULB employees. The system provides the capability to Employees to merge and download bills based on given parameters to plan their distribution drives.

{% hint style="warning" %}
* Generate Demand Notice based on periodic basis
* Group Demand Notices
* Print Demand Notices
* Cancel Demand Notices
* Send notifications to citizens on demand generation- SMS, Whatsapp, Email, Physical bil
{% endhint %}

### Payments collection and Receipts

The citizen/ employee can view payment status of previous assessments from Assessment History section. Payment for any assessment with full or partially paid amount can be completed. Receipts for assessment can be downloaded in Assessment history section after searching for the property details.

{% hint style="warning" %}
* Payment of Property Tax -Online, Cheque, Cash, DD, during assessment
* Partial Payment of Property Tax -Online, Cheque, Cash, DD, during assessment
* The system allows a citizen to pay for anyone's property without changing the demand
