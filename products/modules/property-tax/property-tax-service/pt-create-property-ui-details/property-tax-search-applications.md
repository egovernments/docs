Users can view the application details page by clicking on the application number. The details page allows the employees to initiate and perform different workflow actions.

## **Technical Details**

The below hook is used to call the Property Search API and load the search result:

`1const { isLoading, isSuccess, isError, error, data: {Properties: searchReult, Count: count} = {} } = Digit.Hooks.pt.usePropertySearch( 2 { tenantId, 3 filters: payload 4 }, 5 config, 6 );`
