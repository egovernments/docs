# Property Type

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

The first level of classification of a property based on its construction is defined as Property Type. Generally, the property is divided into two types :

* Built-up
* Vacant Land

Mostly these property types are fixed and commonly used in all the ULBs across the country. Hence this data is not needed anymore in the template.
