# Trade License Fee

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Once the Trade Ontology is defined, the next step is to allocate the license fee associated with the Trades.

Dependent on the Trade Classification Level ([Types](trade-type.md)/ [Subtypes](trade-sub-type.md)), the fee allocated might be the same across the Sate or could vary from ULB to ULB. There could be a distinct fee(s) for two different types of applications (new and renewal).

Following are the key tasks to be executed :

* Allocate the License Fee according to Trade Classification Level (Types/Subtypes).
* Map the License fee with the respective Trade Classification Level.
