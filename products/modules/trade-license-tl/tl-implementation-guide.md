# TL Implementation Guide

## Section 1: Executive Summary

### Overview of the Product

The computerized and automatic Trade License system offered by eGov, facilitates citizens who seek to apply for a Trade License within any Urban Local Body with a transparent, speedy, hassle-free and user-friendly procedure. Trade License (TL) is one of the components of a smart city that ensures a check on all the trade practices and increases the ease of conducting business within the state. Keeping in mind the benefits associated with the product offered, the proposed system is about to be implemented in 500+ ULBs across the country in 15 states. (For details on product features refer to [Section 2](tl-implementation-guide.md#overview-of-the-product))

### Implementation Methodology for TL

For the offered product, the implementation process can be divided into seven major distinctive stages. Each stage has predefined entry and exit criteria, roles & responsibilities to assure objective monitoring and decision-making for the overall success of the engagement. The whole implementation lifecycle is typical of 38-42 weeks for the State, keeping in mind the entry and exit criteria defined at the beginning and end of each stage are met on time recommended.

Exhibit 1: Phases of Implementation.

Stage Zero is that of program setup and onboarding which is a pre-requisite for the initiative to kick-off and requires setup of the governance model, implementation Team and decision regarding other significant elements of the initiative like funding and procurement process.&#x20;

Stage One requires scoping of the initiative and decisions on the priorities for implementation by the State Implementation Team.&#x20;

Stage Two - the State Team works on identifying and finding solutions to the significant gaps in the product offered with respect to the need of the State. Stage Three - involves the Configuration and customization of the product offered. This involves working on various aspects of State-specific needs and incorporating them into the product offered.&#x20;

Stage Four - is about doing a pilot launch in UAT and including all the necessary feedback on the product. Stage Five - the roll-out of the product is done at the State level (Go Live) from a couple of ULBs to pan State coverage in batches. Finally, in Stage Six sustenance and ongoing improvements are worked upon while the product is already functioning in the State. (For details on the implementation plan refer to [Section 3](tl-implementation-guide.md#section-3-trade-license-tl-implementation-methodology))

### Critical Success Factors For Implementation

Implementation of the Trade License (TL) module requires meticulous planning and close coordination between various stakeholders at the centre and State levels. The success of the initiative is dependent upon many factors like strong Program governance, availability of trained resources, financial planning, targeted Implementation Team onboarding, focus on last-mile capacity building and ensuring necessary support to the Urban centre. Achievement of all these factors will provide the most effective and efficient roll-out and adoption of the Trade License System in the State.

## Section 2: Product-Overview

## Section 3: Trade License (TL) Implementation Methodology

This section provides an overview of the methodology for State-wide implementation of TL. The Implementation of TL is distributed across seven distinct stages. Each stage has predefined entry & exit criteria and roles & responsibilities. This is to ensure objective monitoring and decision-making for the overall success of the program. Details of each stage are defined in this section.

{% endhint %}

TL implementation program is expected to be completed approximately between 38- 42 weeks with the resource deployment by the State and System Integrator (SI) Team (as defined below). However, it is critical that activities and exit criteria set for each stage are achieved to adhere to this timeline.

### Seven Stages of Implementation For Trade License

### Stage 0 - Program Setup/Onboarding

This is a set of initial critical activities undertaken on receiving a letter of Enrolment or MOU from the State. Successful completion of these activities assures that the program is started with crucial personnel, System Integrator (SI) Teams, and funds.

**Note:** The Nodal Officer is responsible to identify the ULB officials who are associated with the TL process on the ground and will be working with the technological Product in the respective ULBs
{% endhint %}

### Stage 5 – Rollout

On successful Go-Live in the Pilot ULBs, and further fine-tuning to stabilize the product, the solution will be rolled out to the rest of the ULBs in phases. Guidance and support from the State Team will be required to create the rollout plans and assure the necessary infrastructure for training and deployment is available at each ULB.

{% hint style="info" %}
