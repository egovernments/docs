# TL Service Configuration

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

This service is used to issue a license to the user after verification. The service is designed in such a way that it can be used to serve different type of licenses. Currently used to issue trade licenses, perform stakeholder registration and issue lockdown pass. The service is integrated with workflow where we can define the steps for approval of the application. Once the application is approved the license is generated.

## Integration <a href="#integration" id="integration"></a>

### Integration Scope <a href="#integration-scope" id="integration-scope"></a>

The trade-license service is currently used to issue trade licenses, perform stakeholder registration and issue lockdown pass.

### Integration Benefits <a href="#integration-benefits" id="integration-benefits"></a>

* Provide backend support for the different license registration process.
* Mseva and SMS notifications on application status changes.
* The elastic search index for creating visualizations and Dashboards.
* Bpa Stakeholder registration provides new roles to the user to access the Building Plan Approval system.
* Supports workflow which is configurable

### Steps to Integration <a href="#steps-to-integration" id="steps-to-integration"></a>

1. To integrate, host of tl-services service should be overwritten in the helm chart.
2. {servicename}/\_create/ \_create should be added as the create endpoint for creating any license in the system
3. {servicename}/\_search/ \_search should be added as the search endpoint. This method handles all requests to search existing records depending on different search criteria
4. {servicename}/\_update/ \_update should be added as the update endpoint. This method is used to update fields in existing records or to update the status of the application based on workflow.
