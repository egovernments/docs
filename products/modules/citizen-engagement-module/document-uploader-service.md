# Document Uploader Service

### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Document uploader will be used by ULB employees to upload the document which will then be visible to the citizens. In an effort to increase the engagement of citizens with mSeva platform, mSeva is providing this service to enable the citizens to view important documents related to their ULB such as acts, circulars, citizen charters etc.

### Pre-requisites <a href="#pre-requisites" id="pre-requisites"></a>

1. Prior Knowledge of Java/J2EE.
2. Prior Knowledge of SpringBoot.
3. Prior Knowledge of PostgresSQL.
4. Prior Knowledge of REST APIs and related concepts like path parameters, headers, JSON etc.
5. Prior Knowledge of JSONQuery in Postgres. (Similar to PostgresSQL with a few aggregate functions.)

### Key Functionalities And Configurations <a href="#key-functionalities-and-configurations" id="key-functionalities-and-configurations"></a>

Employees can perform all four operations i.e. creating, searching, updating and deleting the documents whereas the citizens can only search for the created documents. For creating documents in a particular ULB, the document category that needs to be provided in the create API cURL has to be present in the document category MDMS file for the tenantId for which the document is getting uploaded.&#x20;

A sample MDMS document category configuration file can be viewed here - [<img src="https://github.com/fluidicon.png" alt="" data-size="line">egov-mdms-data/DocumentUploader.json at DEV · egovernments/egov-mdms-data](https://github.com/egovernments/egov-mdms-data/blob/DEV/data/pb/DocumentUploader/DocumentUploader.json)

In this MDMS configuration file, ULB key can be added and the allowed category types can be added in categoryList key.

Once a document is created in any ULB, the following attributes can be updated for that document -

1. ULB
2. Document name
3. Document category
4. Links
5. Attachments

Upon deleting any document, that document is soft deleted from the records i.e. that document’s active field is set to false.
