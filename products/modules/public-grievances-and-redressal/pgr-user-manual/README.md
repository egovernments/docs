# PGR User Manual

The Public Grievance Redressal or the PGR is a standardized solution offering on the DIGIT platform to register and redress citizen grievances. It provides a transparent and trackable mechanism to solve public grievances by inducing responsive administration. PGR enables the citizens to file complaints using various channels and helps the municipal employees to resolve them timely.

## Key Features

* Citizens can lodge complaints, track, reopen and rate complaints through the web portal or the mobile application.
* ULB employees too can use the web or mobile interface to comment, forward, assign, verify, share, and resolve citizen complaints.
