## **Functional Demo**

### **Citizen Complaint Registration**

The PGR application digitises the complaints resolution process right from the time of registering complaints to its final resolution. Citizens can now register their complaints using the online portal or even the mobile app.

* The citizen fills in the complaint details in the register complaint screens on the app.
  * The app offers the citizen the scope to share the exact location of the complaint using location sharing services.
  * The citizen can also click pictures in context to the complaint and attach them as evidence.
  * The complaint is filed in few simple steps.
* Citizens receive automated notifications at each step of the complaint resolution process - this enables the citizen to track the status of their complaints easily.
* Citizens can log in to their accounts and check the live status of their complaints anytime.
* Citizens can rate and give their feedback on the resolved complaints.
* Citizens can also reopen complaints in case they are not satisfied with the resolution or if the problem still persists after resolution.

### Employee Complaint Processing

Complaints registered by citizens are routed to concerned employees who assign them to respective field employees for immediate action.

* All complaints registered by citizens are routed to the inbox of the Grievance Redressal Officer (GRO). The GRO reviews these complaints and assigns them to respective Last Mile Employees (LME) for necessary action.
* The GRO can also reject complaints if they are found to be inaccurate or baseless.
* The LME can submit a request for reassigning complaints to other LMEs if required. In such cases, the complaints are routed back to the GRO inbox.
* The LME works on the complaints and marks the complaint status as resolved once the necessary action is taken.
