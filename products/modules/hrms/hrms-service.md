# HRMS Service

HRMS provides extensive APIs to create, update and search the employees with attributes like assignments, service history, jurisdiction, etc. HRMS can be treated as a sub-set of the egov-user service. Every employee created through HRMS is added as a user in the egov-user.&#x20;

### Integration Scope <a href="#integration-scope" id="integration-scope"></a>

The egov-hrms service is used to manage all the employees enrolled in the system. It is used to assign roles under multiple jurisdictions.

### Integration Benefits <a href="#integration-benefits" id="integration-benefits"></a>

* Can create an employee with a specific role to assign it to a particular module.
* Can add any role to an employee across multiple jurisdictions.
* Provide a feature to deactivate and reactivate an employee.

### Steps to Integration <a href="#steps-to-integration" id="steps-to-integration"></a>

1. To integrate, the host of egov-hrms-services module should be overwritten in the helm chart.
2. `egov-hrms/employees/_create` should be added as the create endpoint for creating employees in the system
3. `egov-hrms/employees/_search` should be added as the search endpoint. This method handles all requests to search existing employee records depending on different search criteria
4. `egov-hrms/employees/_update` should be added as the update endpoint. This method is used to update employee details.
5. `egov-hrms/employees/_count` should be added as a count API to get a list of active and inactive employees present in the system.
