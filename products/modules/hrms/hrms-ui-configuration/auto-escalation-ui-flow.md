# Auto Escalation UI Flow

## **Objective**

Refer to the employee inbox technical documentation below before reading the auto-escalation flow details.

{% content-ref url="../../../../platform/configure-digit/configuring-digit-services/property-tax-service/pt-create-property-ui-details/employee-inbox-old-ui.md" %}
[employee-inbox-old-ui.md](../../../../platform/configure-digit/configuring-digit-services/property-tax-service/pt-create-property-ui-details/employee-inbox-old-ui.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

The auto-escalation option provides employees with the option to view all escalated applications that have not been acted on.

## **Technical Implementation Details**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**

1. The tab **ASSIGNED TO ME** is inter-changed to **ALL** vice versa and the **Escalated** tab is added in the 3rd position.
2. **Nearing Escalation and Escalated**: The localisation message of **Escalated** is changed to **SLA Breached.**

Escalated API file path:[ <img src="https://github.com/fluidicon.png" alt="" data-size="line">frontend/actions.js at master · egovernments/frontend](https://github.com/egovernments/frontend/blob/master/web/rainmaker/dev-packages/egov-ui-kit-dev/src/redux/app/actions.js). The escalated API is called based on given conditions.

1. get all applications in `payload.ProcessInstances` using `egov-workflow-v2/egov-wf/process/_search`
2. get the escalated applications in `escalatedPayload.ProcessInstances` using `egov-workflow-v2/egov-wf/escalate/_search`
3. pushing escalated applications into all applications with `isEscalatedApplication` flag with true value, for finding the escalated application in all applications.
4. This works the same as [Employee Inbox](https://digit-discuss.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EGR/pages/1004437517).

### **Escalated Tab**

The Escalated tab shows all Escalated applications.

The process instance response fetches all records from which the records are filtered based on the following condition:

```
if (get(item, "isEscalatedApplication", false)) {
      escalatedToMe.push([...dataRows])
  }
```

The `isEscalatedApplication` is the flag added initially for separating the escalated applications to show in the escalated tab.

### On-Click History

The functionality works as it is but the only change is showing the symbol to identify the state from which it has escalated.
