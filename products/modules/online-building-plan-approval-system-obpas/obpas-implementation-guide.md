# OBPAS Implementation Guide

## Section 1: Executive Summary

### Overview of the Product

The computerised and automatic building permission system offered under the National Urban Stack(NUS) facilitates citizens who seek permission for construction of a building within any Urban Local Body with a transparent, speedy, hassle-free and user-friendly procedure. Online Building Permission System (OBPS) is one of the components of a smart city that has the capability of providing a single window for acquiring building permits, NOCs, and clearances from multiple agencies or departments. Keeping in mind the benefits associated with the product offered, the proposed system is about to be implemented in 500+ ULBs across the country in 15 states and Union Territories. (For details on product features refer to Section-2).

### Implementation Methodology for OBPS

For the offered product, the implementation process can be divided into six major distinctive stages. Each stage has predefined entry and exit criteria, roles & responsibilities to assure objective monitoring and decision making for the overall success of the engagement. The whole implementation lifecycle is typical of 35-40 weeks keeping in mind the entry, and exit criteria defined at the beginning and end of each stage is met within the recommended time.

Stage Zero-program setup and onboarding is a pre-requisite for the initiative to kick-off and requires setup of the governance model, implementation Team and decision regarding other significant elements of the initiative like funding and procurement process.

Stage One of the initiative requires scoping of the initiative and deciding on the priorities for implementation by the state implementation Team.

In stage three, the state Team will work upon identifying and finding solutions to the significant gaps in the product offered w.r.t. to the needs of the state.

Configuration and customisation of the product offered in the primary objective of stage four. This involves working on various aspects of state-specific needs and incorporating them into the product suite offered.

In stage four and five, post doing UAT and including all the necessary feedback on the product, the roll-out of the product is done at the state level (Go Live) from a couple of ULBs to pan state coverage. (For details on the implementation plan refer to Section-3).

### Manpower Requirement For Implementation

The whole implementation cycle requires a Team of individuals with specific skill sets to work very closely. The state implementation unit comprises individuals with Program management, business analysis, implementation engineering, software engineering, architecture (DCR Domain) and capacity building skills. Depending upon the phases of implementing the initiative is in, the amount of effort by each participant in the smaller units will vary. (For details on resource sizing and requirements refer to Section-5)

### Budgetary Requirement For Implementation

Based on close deliberations with various stakeholders, it is recommended that the budgetary allocation for the implementation of the initiative should be around 3 crores to 3.8 crores1 for statewide implementation and Operation and Maintenance Cost (per Year )for the initiative will be approximately 1.35 crores to 2.0 crores2. The budget allocated needs to be utilised for human resources requirements primarily. The budgetary allocation is recommended as per the NICSI standards published on [https://www.nicsi.com/](https://www.nicsi.com/) (Check Annexure 1 for NICSI standard rates). The estimation of the budget will increase or decrease based on the rates applicable to the resources required. (For details on budgetary allocation guidelines refer to Section 5).

### Critical Success Factors For Implementation

Implementation of the Online Building Permission System (OBPS) requires meticulous planning and close coordination between various stakeholders at the centre and state level. The success of the initiative is dependent upon many factors like strong Program governance, availability of the trained resource, financial planning, targeted implementation Team onboarding, focus on last-mile capacity building and ensuring necessary support to urban centres. Achievement of all these factors will provide the most effective and efficient roll-out and adoption of the Building Permission System in the state.\

## Section 2: Online Building Permission System(OBPS) Implementation Methodology

This section provides an overview of the methodology for the state-wide implementation of OBPS. Implementation of OBPS is distributed across six distinct stages. Each stage has predefined entry and exit criteria, roles & responsibilities to assure objective monitoring and decision making for the overall success of the engagement. Details of each stage are defined in this section.

OBPS implementation program is expected to be completed within approximately 37 weeks with the resource deployment by the State and System Integrator(SI) Team (as defined below). However, it is critical that activities and exit criteria set for each stage are achieved to adhere to this timeline.

### Six Stages of Implementation

### Stage 0 - Program Setup/Onboarding

Set of initial critical activities that are undertaken on receiving a Letter of Enrollment from the state. Successful completion of these activities assures that the program is started with crucial personnel, System Integrator(SI) Teams and funds.

### Stage 1 - Program Kick-Off

This stage envisages the in-person interaction of crucial State officials and implementation System Integrator(SI) Teams to kick-start the program. This stage may require multiple interactions/meetings with different interest groups. The principal objective of these interactions is to identify Pilot ULBs, create an active collaboration & Governance approach and agree on a high-level timeline for the engagement.

### Stage 3 - Configuration & Customization

Configuration & customisation stage, spread across 12 weeks, envisages configuration of the product as per the baselined Product Configuration report and identified state-specific customisations. Active involvement of domain experts from the state Team is required in this stage to validate the implementation of state by-laws.

### Stage 5 – Rollout

On successful rollout in the Pilot ULBs, the solution will be rolled out to the rest of the ULBs in batches. Guidance and support from the State Team will be required to create the rollout plans and assure the necessary infrastructure for training and deployment is available at each ULB.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The rollout phase needs to be detailed out for iterative activities of onboarding ULBs in batches.
