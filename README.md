# Introducing DIGIT Urban

## Mission

Building an urban governance platform to catalyze digital transformation across towns and cities - changing the way citizens interact with government bodies.

## Overview

DIGIT Urban Stack is a set of Open APIs, services, and reference implementations, set up as a public good, to allow government entities, businesses, startups, and civil society to use a unique digital Infrastructure and build solutions for urban India at a large scale. It provides a set of open standards, specifications and documentation to create a level playing field and enable ecosystem players to innovate on the stack. As a public good, the platform is provided without profit or restriction to all members of society.

## Goals

The urban mission offers digital governance solutions that encapsulate the core platform principles. The apps provide

* Secure & reliable governance tools
* Simple reusable modules for effective integration
* Scalable & standardized solutions
* Open APIs to promote interoperability
* Multiple channel support
* Configurable building blocks that support customization at each stage

## Approach

DIGIT-Urban focuses on inclusion and is designed on the principle of enhancing both platform openness and choice for citizens. The platform uses open APIs and standards, creating a powerful framework to drive convergence across the multiple systems currently in use and to lower the barrier to entry for locally-developed solutions.&#x20;

Keeping in mind that most Indians use the internet through their phones, we follow and advocate a “mobile-first” approach, while supporting multi-channel access to accommodate diverse needs and preferences.
