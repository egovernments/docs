### Our Core Principles

DIGIT focuses on inclusion and is designed on the principle of enhancing both platform openness and choice for citizens.  The platform uses open APIs and standards, creating a powerful framework to drive convergence across the multiple systems currently in use and to lower the barrier to entry for locally-developed solutions. Keeping in mind that most Indians use the internet through their phones, we follow and advocate a “mobile-first” approach, while supporting multi-channel access to accommodate diverse needs and preferences.
