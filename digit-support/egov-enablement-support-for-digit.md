# eGov Enablement Support for DIGIT

### Objectives

eGov will enable partners to implement the DIGIT platform and products across ULBs for a State. As part of the enablement process, eGov will assist the partner by providing them product training, implementation training and training them on technical support for supporting the system. 

The key objectives for partner enablement are:

1. Clearly communicate the DIGIT enablement support strategy, and support commitment to the State and Partner.
2. Conduct training sessions to bring State/Partner up to speed on the DIGIT platform and products.
3. Provide channels of communication to continue extending support through the project implementation.
4. Assist the clients/partners in resolving incidents that are attributable to DIGIT.

### Scope of Enablement Support

The goal is to enable the State/Partner to be able to implement the DIGIT platform and products at speed and scale. They should not only be able to deploy the existing set of applications, but also be able to deliver new solutions on top of the DIGIT platform as per needs. The State/Partner should also be able to train their staff on these topics once they have been enabled suitably.

1. Enable partner to setup and maintain infrastructure required
2. Enable partner to do basic customization of the delivered services
3. Enable partner in data migration process and master data preparation
4. Enable partner on integrations or extensions \(APIs, UI Framework, Workflow, payment gateways\)
5. Enable partner to customize existing UI and Modules as per client needs
6. Enable partner to deliver new reports and make customizations on the DIGIT dashboards
7. Enable partner to implement and exercise best practices shared by NUS
8. Enable partner to manage DIGIT System upgrade activities independently

### Enablement Process

To enable the State/Partner to be self-sufficient, the following practices will be utilized:

* Advisory
  * Key eGov staff will participate in program steering committee meetings and leadership meetings, with a view to:
* Enablement Activities
  * eGov team will provide a training plan of topics and modules, based on State/Partner priorities. A training calendar is put together to schedule all the sessions required along with suitable participant profiles.
  * eGov team will share documentation relating to the DIGIT platform and products along with the training sessions. Some of these documents will be pre-reads for the training sessions. Training videos will be shared post training sessions.
  * eGov team will also share knowledge assets on tools to be used, “how to” documents as well as tools that can be used to configure and set the platform up. This includes the following:
    * Configuration guides to setup each DIGIT module
    * Setting up and handling master data for DIGIT platform and products
    * Customization guides - how to make changes using hooks in the backend and front end
    * Troubleshooting and debugging techniques within DIGIT
    * Data migration approach and process
    * DevOps related practices - CI/CD pipeline setup, monitoring tools setup
    * Upgrade considerations
