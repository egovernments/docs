# Configuring Tenants

## Overview

Tenant represents a body in a system. In the municipal system, a state and its ULBs (Urban local bodies) are tenants. ULB represents a city or a town in a state. Tenant configuration is done in MDMS.

## Pre-requisites

Before proceeding with the configuration, the following pre-requisites are met -

* Knowledge of json and how to write a json is required.
* Knowledge of MDMS is required.
* User with permission to edit the git repository where MDMS data is configured.

## Key Functionalities

* For the login page city name selection is required. Tenant added in MDMS shows in city drop-down of the login page.
* In reports or in the employee inbox page the details related to ULB is displayed from the fetched ULB data which is added in MDMS.
* Modules i.e., TL, PT, MCS can be enabled based on the requirement for the tenant.

## Deployment Details

After adding the new tenant, the MDMS service needs to be restarted to read the newly added data.

## Configuration Details

Tenant is added in tenant.json.\
In MDMS, file **tenant.json**, under **tenant** folder holds the details of state and ULBs to be added in that state.

{% hint style="info" %}
To enable tenants the above data should be pushed in tenant.json file. Here "ULB Grade" and City "Code" are important fields. **ULB Grade** can have a set of allowed values that determines the ULB type, ([Municipal corporation (Nagar Nigam)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal\_Corporations\_in\_India), Municipality (municipal council, municipal board, municipal committee) (Nagar Parishad), etc). City "**Code**" has to be unique to each tenant. This city-specific code is used in all transactions. Not permissible to change the code. If changed we will lose the data of the previous transactions done.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Naming Convention for **Tenants Code**

**“Code”:“uk.citya”** is **StateTenantId.ULBTenantName"**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**"logoId": "**[**https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/uk-egov-assets/uk.citya/logo.png**](https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/pb-egov-assets/pb.citya/logo.png)**",** Here the last section of the path should be "/\<tenantId>/logo.png". If we use anything else, logo will not be displayed on the UI. **\<tenantId>** is the tenant code ie **“uk.citya”.**
{% endhint %}

Localization should be pushed for ULB grade and ULB name. The format is given below.

**Localization for ULB Grade**

```
{
     "code": "ULBGRADE_MUNICIPAL_CORPORATION",
     "message": "MUNICIPAL CORPORATION",
     "module": "rainmaker-common",
     "locale": "en_IN"
  }
```

**Localization for ULB Name**

```
{
     "code": "TENANT_TENANTS_UK_HALDWANI",    
     "message": "Haldwani",
     "module": "rainmaker-tl",
     "locale": "en_IN"
}
```

**Format of localization code for tenant name** <**MDMS\_State\_Tenant\_Folder\_Name**>\_<**Tenants\_Fille\_Name**>\_<**Tenant\_Code**> (replace dot with underscore)

Boundary data should be added for the new tenant.
