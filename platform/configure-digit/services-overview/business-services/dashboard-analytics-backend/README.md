# Dashboard Analytics - Backend

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

DSS has two sides to it. One is the process in which the data is pooled to ElasticSearch and the other is the way it is fetched, aggregated, computed, transformed and sent across. DSS must be configurable since the entire process involves playing around with a variety of data sets. This ensures easy configuration of data sets in new scenarios.

This document explains the steps on how to define the configurations for both sides of DSS Analytics and Ingest Pipeline Services.

## Commonly Used Terms <a href="#abbreviations" id="abbreviations"></a>

**Ingest:** Micro Service which runs as a pipeline and manages to validate, transform and enrich the incoming data and pushes the same to ElasticSearch Index

**Analytics:** Micro Service which is responsible for building, fetching, aggregating and computing the Data on ElasticSearch to a consumable Data Response. Which shall be later used for visualizations and graphical representations.

**JOLT:** JSON to JSON transformation library written in Java where the "specification" for the transform is itself a JSON document

**Modules / Domain Level:** These are the Services in this context. Each of the services, such as Property Tax, Trade License, Water and Sewerages are considered as Modules / Domains

**Chart:** Each individual graphical representation is considered as a Chart in specific. For example, a Metric of Total Collection is considered as a Chart.

**Visualization:** Group of different Charts is considered as a Visualization. For example, the group of Total Collection, Target Collection and Target Achieved is considered as a Metric Collection of Charts and thus it becomes a Visualization.

## Configuration Details <a href="#ingest-pipeline-configurations" id="ingest-pipeline-configurations"></a>

Discussed below are the ingest pipeline configuration details -

1. Topic Context Configurations
2. Validator Schema
3. JOLT Transformation Schema
4. Enrichment Domain Configuration
5. JOLT Domain Transformation Schema

### Topic Context Configurations

Topic context configuration is an outline to define which data is received on which Kafka Topic.

Indexer Service and many other services are sending out data on different Kafka Topics. If the Ingest Service receives the data and passes it through the pipeline, the context and the version of the data received have to be set. This configuration is used to identify which Kafka topic consumed the data and the mapping details.

| Parameter Name     | Description                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| topic              | Holds the name of the Kafka Topic on which the data is being received                                              |
| dataContext        | Context Name which needs to be set for further actions in the pipeline                                             |
| dataContextVersion | Version of the Data Structure is set here as there might be different structured data at a different point in time |

### Validator Schema

Validator schema is a configuration schema library from **Everit.** By passing the data against this schema, it ensures whether the data abides by the rules and requirements of the schema that has been defined.

![Figure 2](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/111.png)

[Click here for an example configuration](https://github.com/egovernments/configs/blob/master/egov-dss-dashboards/dashboard-ingest/validator\_transaction\_v1.json)

### JOLT Transformation Schema

JOLT is a JSON to JSON transformation library. In order to change the structure of the data and transform it in a generic way, JOLT has been used.

While the transformation schemas are written for each data context, the data is transformed against the schema to obtain transformed data.

[Follow the slide deck for JOLT Transformations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sAiuiFC4Lzz4-064sg1p8EQt2ev0o442MfEbvrpD1ls/edit#slide=id.p)

### Enrichment Domain Configuration

This configuration defines and directs the enrichment process that the data goes through.

For example, if the data which is incoming is belonging to a collection module data, then the collection domain config is picked. And based on the specified business type the right config is picked.

In order to enhance the data of collection, the domain index specified in the configuration is queried with the right arguments and the response data is obtained, transformed and set.

| Parameter Name                                | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id                                            | Unique Identifier for the Configuration within the configuration document                                                                                              |
| businessType                                  | This defines as in which kind of Domain / Service is the data related to. Based on this business type, query and enhancements are decided                              |
| indexName                                     | Based on Business Type, Index Name is defined as to which index has to be queried to get the enhancements done from                                                    |
| query                                         | Query to execute to get the Domain Level Object is defined here.                                                                                                       |
| <p>targetReferences</p><p>sourceReference</p> | Fields which are variables in order to get the domain level objects are defined here. The variables and where all the values has to be picked from are documented here |

### JOLT Domain Transformation Schema

As a part of enhancement, once the domain level object is obtained, we might not need the complete document as is in the end data product.

Only those parameters which should be or can be used for aggregation and representation are to be held and others are to be discarded.

In order to do that, we make use of JOLT again and write schemas to keep the required ones and discard the unwanted ones.

The above configuration is used to transform the data response in the enrichment layer.

![Figure 4](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/113.png)

[Click here for an example configuration](https://github.com/egovernments/configs/blob/master/egov-dss-dashboards/dashboard-ingest/transform\_tl\_v1.json)

Use case:- JOLT Transformation Schema for collection V2

JOLT transformation schema for payment-v1 has been taken as a use case to explain the context collection and context version v2. The payment records are processed/transformed with the schema. The schema supports splitting the billing records into an independent new record. So if there are 2 bill items in the collection/payment incoming data then this results in 2 collection records in turn.

![Figure 5](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/114.png)

[Click here for an example configuration](https://github.com/egovernments/configs/blob/master/egov-dss-dashboards/dashboard-ingest/transform\_collection\_v2.json)

Here: **$i**, the variable value that gets incremented for the number of records of paymentDetails

**$j**, the variable value that gets incremented for the number of records of bill details.

**Note:** For Kafka connect to work, Ingest pipeline application properties or in environments direct push must be disabled.

es.push.direct=false

## Analytics Configurations <a href="#analytics-configurations" id="analytics-configurations"></a>

Below is the list of configurations

1. Chart API Configuration
2. Master Dashboard Configuration
3. Role Dashboard Mappings Configuration

### Chart API Configuration

Each Visualization has its own properties. Each Visualization comes from different data sources (Sometimes it is a combination of different data sources)

In order to configure each visualization and its properties, we have Chart API Configuration Document.

In this, Visualization Code, which happens to be the key, will be having its properties configured as a part of the configuration and are easily changeable.

## Adding Configurations <a href="#adding-configurations" id="adding-configurations"></a>

### Adding Roles and Dashboards

To add a new role, modify the RoleDashboardMappingsConf.json (**roles** node) configuration file as given below.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Any number of roles & dashboards can be added
{% endhint %}

Below as in Figure 9 is a sample to add a new role object, a new dashboard object.

![Figure 9](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/120.png)

To add a new dashboard, modify the MasterDashboardConfig.json (**dashboards** node) as shown below in Figure 10.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: dashboards array add a new dashboard as given below
{% endhint %}

![Figure 10](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/121.png)

## Adding Visualizations&#x20;

To add new visualisations, modify the MasterDashboardConfig.json (**vizArray** node) as shown in Figure 11.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** vizArray is used to hold multiple visualizations.
{% endhint %}

![Figure 11](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/122.png)

## Adding Charts&#x20;

To add a new chart, chartApiConf.json has to be modified as shown below. A new chartid has to be added with the chart node object.

**Metric chart Sample as shown in Figure 12.**

![Figure 12](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/123.png)

**Pie chart Sample as shown in Figure 13.**

![Figure 13](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/124.png)

**Line chart Sample as shown in Figure 14.**

![Figure 14](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/125.png)

**Table chart Sample:** This chart is of 2 types - table and xtable.table (as shown in Figure 15.) Type allows the addition of aggregated fields as available in the query keys. To extract the values based on the key, **aggegationPaths** have to be added along with their data type as in **pathDataTypeMapping**.

![Figure 15](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/126.png)

xtable (as shown in Figure 16) type allows the addition of multiple computed fields with the aggregated fields added dynamically.

To add multiple computed columns, define the following params within **computedFields** \[]&#x20;

* actionName - (IComputedField\<T> interface),&#x20;
* fields - \[] names as existing in the query key,&#x20;
* newField - name to appear for the computation

![Figure 16](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/127.png)

[https://github.com/egovernments/configs/blob/master/egov-dss-dashboards/dashboard-analytics/ChartApiConfig.json](https://github.com/egovernments/configs/blob/master/egov-dss-dashboards/dashboard-analytics/ChartApiConfig.json) for the full configuration in detail.

Steps to create charts and visualise are:

* Create/Add a chart in chartApiConf.json
* Add a visualization for the existing dashboard in MasterDashboardConfig.json as defined above.
* Or in order to create/add a new dashboard create the dashboard in MasterDashboardConfig.json and create a role in RoleDashboardConfig.json

**Configuration Changes For DrillThroughs:**

Example - drill through in ward table in the property tax dashboard.

wardDrillDown is the visualization code for PT Drill Down. The 'kind' attribute shows the type of visualization code. Apart from two things all the attributes are common.

![](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/128.png)

Example - Drill through in the ComplaintList table in the PGR Dashboard.

complaintDrillDown is the visualization code for PGR Drill Down.

![](../../../../../.gitbook/assets/129.png)

The above complaintDrillDown visualization code is called in the drill chart parameter.
