# DSS Technical Documentation

## Overview

A decision support system (DSS) is a composite tool that collects, organizes and analyzes business data to facilitate quality decision-making for management, operations and planning. A well-designed DSS aids decision-makers in compiling a variety of data from many sources: raw data, documents, personal knowledge from employees, management, executives and business models. DSS analysis helps organizations identify and solve problems, and make decisions.
