# Collection Service Migration

## Overview

According to the new collection service, which follows the payment structure for storing information about payments and payment details, it is necessary to migrate the old collection structure into the new payment structure.

## Migration Details

In the old collection service, for every transaction, the receipt number is generated on the bill detail level. Since the bill contains multiple bill details each transaction is mapped to multiple receipt numbers. So after payment of a single bill, multiple receipt numbers are generated. The mapping of the transactions to the receipt number changed in the new collection service.

In the new collection service, the receipt number is generated at the bill level. For each bill transaction, one receipt number is generated. So every bill for a consumer code and business service has one receipt number.

The records from tables **egcl\_receiptheader**, **egcl\_receiptdetails**, **egcl\_instrument**, **egcl\_instrumentheader** need to be transferred into tables **egcl\_payment**, **egcl\_paymentdetail**, **egcl\_bill**, **egcl\_billdetial**, **egcl\_billaccountdetail.**

For smooth data transactions, the record from the old receipt is mapped according to the payment structure. The new payment response can be formed with receipt data.

The table below provides the mapping between receipt and payment structure with some remarks.

After the creation of the payment response with receipt data, it is pushed into the Kafka topic **“egov.collection.migration-batch”.** The persister inserts the payment data into tables - **egcl\_payment**, **egcl\_paymentdetail**, **egcl\_bill**, **egcl\_billdetial**, **egcl\_billaccountdetail.**

These need to get promoted before initiating the migration process. Migration happens through an API call, add role-actions based on your requirement. Otherwise, port-forwarding will work.

## API Details

Endpoint: /collection-services/payments/\_migrate?batchSize=100\&offset=\
Body:\
{\
"RequestInfo": {\
"apiId": "Rainmaker",\
"action": "",\
"did": 1,\
"key": "",\
"msgId": "20170310130900|en\_IN",\
"ts": 0,\
"ver": ".01",\
"authToken": "a6ad2a1b-821c-4688-a70e-4322f6c34e54"\
}

In case of any failure and restarting migration, take the value of _**offset**_ and _**tenantId**_ printed in the logs and resume the migration process.

**/collection-services/payments/\_migrate?batchSize=100\&offset=200\&tenantId='pb.tenantId'**
