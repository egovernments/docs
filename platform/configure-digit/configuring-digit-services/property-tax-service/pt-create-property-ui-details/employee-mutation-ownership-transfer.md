# Employee - Mutation (Ownership Transfer)

**Objective:** To Provide employees with functionality to transfer Ownership of an active property.

## **Documents Required for Mutate Property Page**

When a property is in active status and has no dues to pay, the employee has the option to mutate a property on the Property Details page.

**MDMS Data Used**

Similar to the MDMS used in employee Property Create flow and the Mutation Documents flow. Mutation documents MDMS data file link: [<img src="https://github.com/fluidicon.png" alt="" data-size="line">egov-mdms-data/MutationDocuments.json at DEV · egovernments/egov-mdms-data](https://github.com/egovernments/egov-mdms-data/blob/DEV/data/pb/PropertyTax/MutationDocuments.json)

**APIs Called:** `1property-services/property/_update`

When update API is called the documents are updated in accordance to the snippet below:-

```
 documents: [
          ...data.originalData?.documents.filter(
            (oldDoc) => !mutationDocs?.PropertyTax?.MutationDocuments.some((mut) => oldDoc.documentType.includes(mut.code))
          ),
          ...data.documents.documents.map((e) =>
            e.documentType.includes("OWNER.TRANSFERREASONDOCUMENT") ? { ...e, documentType: e.documentType.split(".")[2] } : e
          ),
        ],
```

Here `data.originalData` is the property before the update. The `data.documents` is the documents that were uploaded in the form, and `mutationDocs` is the MDMS response for Mutation Docs.

**Acknowledgement Screen**

If the Property Mutation is successful. then the employee is directed to the acknowledgement screen. The screen displays the Acknowledgement Id and the option to download a pdf copy of the acknowledgement containing property details.
