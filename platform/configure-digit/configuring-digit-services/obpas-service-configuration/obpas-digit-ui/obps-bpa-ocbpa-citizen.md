## **Localisation**

Localisation keys are added under the ‘_rainmaker-bpa_’ and ‘rainmaker-bpareg’ locale modules. In future, if any new labels are implemented in the OBPS - Architect (Citizen) they should also be pushed to the locale DB under '_rainmaker-bpa'_ locale module. Below is an example of a few locale labels.&#x20;
