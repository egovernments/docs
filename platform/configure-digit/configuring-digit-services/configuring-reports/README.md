# Configuring New Reports

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Through report service, useful data get shown for a specific module based on some given criteria like date, locality, financial year, etc.

For example, PT dump report of property tax service you have to select from date to date, financial year etc and based on the criteria we can see all the data full filling the criteria. In the response we see all the details of a property which is paid between the given from date and to date, if we selected financial year then we can see the property which is paid for that specific financial year.

## Pre-requisites <a href="#pre-requisites" id="pre-requisites"></a>

Before you proceed with the configuration, make sure the following pre-requisites are met -

* User with permission to edit the git repository where reports are configured.
* Prior knowledge of YAML.
* Prior knowledge of SQL queries.

## Key Functionalities <a href="#key-functionalities" id="key-functionalities"></a>

* Users can write queries (like SQL queries) for fetching real-time data to display in a UI application.

## Deployment Details <a href="#deployment-details" id="deployment-details"></a>

Once the changes have been done in the report configuration file we have to restart the report service so the report service will read the new configuration.

## Configuration Details <a href="#configuration-details" id="configuration-details"></a>

* To add a new report first add the file path in the reportFileLocationsv1\[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egovernments/configs/DEV/reports/reportFileLocationsv1.txt\]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/egovernments/configs/DEV/reports/reportFileLocationsv1.txt]) (In this file, the path of the report configuration files get stored).
  * \<Module Name>=file:///work-dir/configs/reports/config/\<report file name>.yml
  * ex: pgr=file:///work-dir/configs/reports/config/pgr-reports.yml
* Once file path is added in the file reportFileLocationsv1, go to the folder /configs/reports/config \[[<img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicon.ico" alt="" data-size="line">https://github.com/egovernments/configs/tree/DEV/reports/config%5D. - Connect to preview](https://github.com/egovernments/configs/tree/DEV/reports/config].)
