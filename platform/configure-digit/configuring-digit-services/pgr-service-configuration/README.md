# PGR Service Configuration

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Public Grievances & Redressal (PGR) is a system that enables citizens to raise a complaint with the ULBs. A citizen can track the complaint, upload image related to the complaint, re-open the complaint if he/she is not satisfied and rate the service. This document contains the details about how to setup PGR service and describes the functionalities it provides

## Pre-requisites <a href="#pre-requisites" id="pre-requisites"></a>

Before you proceed with the configuration, make sure the following pre-requisites are met -

* Java 8
* Kafka server is up and running
* egov-persister service is running and has pgr-services persister config path added in it
* PSQL server is running and database is created to store complaint data
* _(Optional)_ Indexer config for pgr-services is added in egov-indexer yaml paths to index the generated data. Index is required for data visualisation in Kibana or in DSS.
* _(Optional)_ Report config for pgr-services is added in Report service config paths. Required if reports are to be provided to the user.
* Following services should be up and running:
  * egov-user
  * egov-workflow-v2
  * egov-perister
  * egov-localization
  * egov-notification-sms
  * egov-mdms
  * egov-idgen
  * egov-url-shortening
  * egov-hrms

## Key Functionalities <a href="#key-functionalities" id="key-functionalities"></a>

* A citizen can file, track and rate the complaint
* A citizen can add image and comments related to the complaint
* A citizen can re-open the complaint in a certain given period of time after resolution
* ULB can setup the complaint workflow according to their requirements and staff capacity
* ULB can track the SLA for resolving each complaint and can use it as a metric to streamline the process for resolving complaints
* Department wise assignment of the complaint to the LME

## Deployment Details <a href="#deployment-details" id="deployment-details"></a>

1. Deploy the latest version of pgr-services
2. Add pgr-service-persister.yml file in config folder in git and add that path in persister. _(The file path is to be added in environment yaml file in param called_ persist-yml-path _)_
3. If any Report Config is created, the config should be added to the config folder in git and that path should be added in Report service. (_The file path is to be added in a file called “reportFileLocationsv1.txt” in Config folder_)
4. If index is to be created add the indexer config path in indexer service. (_The file path is to be added in environment yaml file in param called_ egov-indexer-yaml-repo-path)

## Configuration Details <a href="#configuration-details" id="configuration-details"></a>

1. Add master data in MDMS service with the module name as RAINMAKER-PGR. Following is some sample master data for the service:

```
{
  "tenantId": "pb",
  "moduleName": "RAINMAKER-PGR",
  "ServiceDefs": [
    {
      "serviceCode": "NoStreetlight",
      "keywords": "streetlight, light, repair, work, pole, electric, power, repair, damage, fix",
      "department": "Streetlights",
      "slaHours": 336,
      "menuPath": "StreetLights",
      "active": false,
      "order": 1
    },
    {
      "serviceCode": "StreetLightNotWorking",
      "keywords": "streetlight, light, repair, work, pole, electric, power, repair, fix",
      "department": "DEPT_1",
      "slaHours": 336,
      "menuPath": "StreetLights",
      "active": true,
      "order": 2
    },
    {
      "serviceCode": "GarbageNeedsTobeCleared",
      "keywords": "garbage, collect, litter, clean, door, waste, remove, sweeper, sanitation, dump, health, debris, throw",
      "department": "DEPT_25",
      "slaHours": 336,
      "menuPath": "Garbage",
      "active": true,
      "order": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

Create businessService (workflow configuration) using the \_\_/businessservice/\_create. Following is the product configuration for PGR:

Using /localization/messages/v1/\_upsert , add localisation (templates) for notification messages to be sent. Following are the product notification templates:

```
{
  "messages": [
       {
            "code": "PGR_APPLY_PENDINGFORASSIGNMENT_SMS_MESSAGE",
            "message": "Dear Citizen, Your complaint for <complaint_type> has been submitted with ID <id> on <date>. You can track your complaint status on the mSeva Punjab mobile App (download here - <download link>) or your local municipal web portal.",
            "module": "rainmaker-pgr",
            "locale": "en_IN"
        },
        {
            "code": "PGR_RESOLVE_RESOLVED_SMS_MESSAGE",
            "message": "Dear Citizen, Your complaint for <complaint_type> with ID <id> submitted on <date> has been resolved by <emp_name>.

            "locale": "en_IN"
        }      
    ]
}
```

Add Role-Action mapping for the APIs in MDMS. Following are the required entries. They should be mapped to both CITIZEN and appropriate employee roles.

```
{
  {
      "id": {{ID_PLACEHOLDER}},
      "name": "Create PGR Request",
      "url": "/pgr-services/v2/requests/_create",
      "parentModule": "",
      "displayName": "Create PGR Request",
      "orderNumber": 0,
      "enabled": false,
      "serviceCode": "pgr-services",
      "code": "null",
      "path": ""
    },
    {
      "id": {{ID_PLACEHOLDER}},
      "name": "Update PGR Request",
      "url": "/pgr-services/v2/requests/_update",
      "parentModule": "",
      "displayName": "Update PGR Request",
      "orderNumber": 0,
      "enabled": false,
      "serviceCode": "pgr-services",
      "code": "null",
