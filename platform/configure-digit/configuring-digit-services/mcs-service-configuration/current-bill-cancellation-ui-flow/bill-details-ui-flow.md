The details of the Bill are fetched by calling BillingService fetchBill API and the [Consumer.No](http://consumer.no/) is used in the query param.

FetchBill API returns the Bill Object which contains all the details about the bill including Billing Period, Due Amount, Due Date, and information about the Tax, Cess, Rebate, and Penalty applied to this bill.

NextStep - On clicking on the next step, the screen navigates to the cancel bill screen. The user must select the option that best states the reason for bill cancellation. More details for the cancel bill screen is available on this page -[ Cancel Bill](cancel-bill-ui-flow.md)
