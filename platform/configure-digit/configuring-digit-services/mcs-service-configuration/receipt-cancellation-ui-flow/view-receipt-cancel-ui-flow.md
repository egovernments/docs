## **View Receipt**

The search page displays the receipts. Click on the specific receipt number navigates the user to view the receipt details.

View receipt details are available here [https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/receipts/src/pages/ReceiptDetails.js](https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/receipts/src/pages/ReceiptDetails.js)

## **Technical Implementation**&#x20;

The initial MDMS call is made on page load. CancelReceiptReason MDMS is used to display multiple reasons for cancelling.

```
     moduleDetails: [
        {
          moduleName: "common-masters",
          masterDetails: [
            {
              name: "CancelReceiptReason"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
```

## **Cancel Receipt**

Action modal - This appears with the click of Cancel Receipt.\
The cancel receipt action is shown only for the following state of receipt.

`Receipt?.paymentStatus !== "CANCELLED" && Receipt?.paymentStatus !== "DEPOSITED" && (Receipt?.instrumentStatus == "APPROVED" || Receipt?.instrumentStatus == "REMITTED"`
