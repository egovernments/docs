# Kafka Consumer Producer Approach

## **Workflow Introduction**

This document is to provide a high-level abstraction of Kafka workflow. Same documentation would be scaled to granular technical components as and when a grouping of services can be categorised from the ecosystem.

Itâ€™s important to note that we need to have closure engagements between development, solution engineering and QA automation teams to accommodate data streaming, staging and ecosystem workflows.

Kafka SMS Consumers

**egov.core.notification.sms** : egov-notification-sms listens to this topic to get the data.

Kafka Email Consumers

**egov.core.notification.email** : egov-notification-mail listens to this topic to listen for the updates on emails and then to send notifications to user.

Kafka Producers

Following are the Producer topic:

**egov.core.notification.sms.otp** :- This topic is used to send OTP to user mobile number.

**org.egov.core.notification.email** :- This topic is used to send OTP to user email id.

### **Approach 1: User OTP**

The user-otp service send the OTP to user on login request, on password change request and during new user registration.

1. /userOtp API - Invoke (**PRODUCER**) this API using Karate (user-otp).
2. Connect to the Kafka Server running on QA using karate with respective TOPIC.
3. Define a Consumer class for the OTP producer Topic for reading producer data. Consumers will listen to the topic and verify for a given mobile number for which OTP has been generated or not.
4. Persist OTP produced data across the test flow of User OTP API.

### **Actions to Explore and Data Collection**

1. Full set of Producer and Consumer list required from End to End Eco-system
2. Filter grouping, Replication, High Availability, Broker Config Elements

### **Log Aggregation Solution**

1. Log Aggregation Solution: Collect logs from a number of eGov services and then make them available to consumers in a standard format.
