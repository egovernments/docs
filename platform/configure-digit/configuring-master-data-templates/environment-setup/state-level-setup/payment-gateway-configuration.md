# Payment Gateway Configuration

### Introduction

DIGIT has modules which require the user to pay for the service that he/ she is availing for example property tax, trade license etc. . In order to achieve the functionality, we have a common payment gateway developed which acts a liaison between DIGIT apps and external payment gateways (which depends on the client requirements).

This module facilitates payments and lookup of transaction status.

### Data Table

Following are the details required from the payment gateway vendor in order to configure the payment gateway:

#### Steps to fill data

The payment gateway is a vendor oriented service that is integrated with different modules in order to facilitate the transactions. Below mentioned are the steps which are followed:

1. The client has to finalize a payment gateway vendor (for example PAYU, Paytm, HDFC, AXIS atc.) depending upon the requirements.
2. Get a good understanding of all the headers in the template sheet, their data type, size, and definitions by referring to the ‘Data Definition’ section of this document.

### Checklist

The checklist is a set of activities to be performed one the data is filled into a template to ensure data type, size, and format of data is as per the expectation. These activities have been divided into 2 groups as given below.

#### Common Checklist
