# Workflow Data Templates

A **workflow process** is a series of sequential tasks that are carried out based on user-**defined** rules or conditions, to execute a business **process**. It is a collection of data, rules, and tasks that need to be completed to achieve a certain business outcome.

In DIGIT, workflow for a business process is divided into three units out of which two are completely configurable while the remaining is fixed and lays the foundation of the other two.

#### Workflow Actions <a href="#workflow-actions" id="workflow-actions"></a>

This is the first unit which defines the actions and its nature which are basically executed during the workflow process by the workflow actors. It plays the foundation and configurable in nature as per the ground needs.

#### Workflow Levels <a href="#workflow-levels" id="workflow-levels"></a>

This is the second unit which defines the number of steps a workflow process may have and then trigger the creation role for each and every step with appropriate rights to perform a set of actions at each step. It is completely configurable.

#### Workflow Process <a href="#workflow-process" id="workflow-process"></a>

This is the third unit which defines the workflow process including the steps, roles with actions and the present, next and previous state of a step/level of the workflow process. It is completely configurable.
