# National DSS & State DSS Release Notes

### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

In this release of the National Urban Dashboard, both state and national level DSS instances were developed for some modules and only the national level instance for a few others.

### Release Highlights <a href="#release-highlights" id="release-highlights"></a>

All the module dashboards have the following common features:

* Filters for the date range, States, ULBs
* Denominations to change the revenue metrics view
* Drill down feature in the service report where state wise, ULB wise, and ward wise reports are available by clicking on the boundary name
* Definitions for all the metrics and chart elements are viewable by hovering over the desired element/metric
* The search feature in the filter boxes and service tabular reports
* Download, share (WhatsApp, email) for individual cards and overall dashboard

Each module dashboard presents the aggregated urban data from the ward, ULB, and state levels in concise charts, graphs, and also in raw numbers as per the KPIs defined. Except for Landing Page, all the other modules are similar for both national and state-level instances.
