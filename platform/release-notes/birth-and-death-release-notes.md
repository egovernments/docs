# Birth & Death Release Notes

## Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

The Birth and Death module provides a digital interface, allowing citizens to search for and download the Birth and Death certificate. Also, the correctness of the certificate can be verified by scanning the QR code.  The module enables the following:

* Reduced physical touchpoints as citizens are not required to visit offices
* Reduced time with the instantaneous download of certificates
* Verification of the correctness of the certificate by scanning the QR Code

The Birth & Death module also enables ULB employees to create new registrations and also search for any previous applications through the employee side interface of the module.

In addition to the module, the DSS(Decision Support System) at the state level and national level instances enables administrators to view the records and have an aggregate view of the certificate downloads and other metrics for research and analysis purposes. The demographic data of the birth and death records also helps administrators to detect anomalies and make data-driven decisions.
