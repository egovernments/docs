# Building Usage Type

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Buildings can be classified into various categories on the basis of their usage. Different fire stations can have different ontology for building usage type but in order to provide citizens and businesses a uniform experience, it is important that the building usage types ontology is standardized at the state level.

For this purpose, the states can also use the National Building Code of India (NBC), a comprehensive building code, which is a national instrument providing guidelines for regulating building construction activities across the country.
