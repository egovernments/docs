## Introduction

Manual processes related to scrutiny, approval, or rejection of building construction or renovation plans is a time-consuming process for both citizens and employees. The DIGIT OBPAS module automates the entire building plan approval process right from enabling online submission of plans, documents to initiating verification and final approval of the plan. Citizens can now track their plan approval or inspection status, pay fees online, download and print the Permit Order and Occupancy Certificate online.
