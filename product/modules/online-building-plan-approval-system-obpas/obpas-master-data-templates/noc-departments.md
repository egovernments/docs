# NOC Departments

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

No objection certificates (NOC) are certifications or permissions acquired from various bodies like Airport authority, monument authority, etc before any construction activities actually take place.

To acquire a building permit, an applicant needs to acquire NOC from the concerned authorities. Add the specific authorities at the State/ULB level in the NOC Departments master list for automated processing of NOCs. Refer to the [National Bye-Laws](http://mohua.gov.in/upload/uploadfiles/files/Chap-4.pdf) for details on State/ULB specific NOC requirements.
