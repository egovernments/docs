# Trade License Document Attachment

## Introduction <a id="Introduction"></a>

Along with the [rates](trade-license-fee.md), the Trade License application process does require certain documents as an attachment of proof. The proof can be defined by a set of documents ranging from

* Identification Proof \(Drivers License/ Voter Card/ Adhaar/ Pan etc.\)
* Trade Premises Proof \(Lease Agreement, Electricity Bills, etc\).
* Misc Documents \(Affidavit, Self- Declaration, etc\).

The Number and the Documents required could vary across the State, ULB\(s\), and might be dependent on Trade Subtypes, all of which are totally configurable on DIGIT.
