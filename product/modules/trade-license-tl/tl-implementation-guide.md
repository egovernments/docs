Exhibit 1: Phases of Implementation.

Stage Zero is that of program setup and onboarding which is a pre-requisite for the initiative to kick-off and requires setup of the governance model, implementation Team and decision regarding other significant elements of the initiative like funding and procurement process. Stage One requires scoping of the initiative and decisions on the priorities for implementation by the State Implementation Team. In stage two, the State Team will work upon identifying and finding solutions to the significant gaps in the product offered with respect to the need of the State. Configuration and customization of the product offered is the primary objective of stage four. This involves working on various aspects of State-specific needs and incorporating them into the product offered. In stage five, post doing UAT and including all the necessary feedback on the product, the roll-out of the product is done at the State level (Go Live) from a couple of ULBs to pan State coverage in batches. Finally, in stage 6 sustenance and ongoing improvements are worked upon while the product is already functioning in the State. (For details on implementation plan refer to Section-3)

### Critical Success Factors for implementation

Implementation of Trade License (TL) requires meticulous planning and close coordination between various stakeholders at the center and State level. The success of the initiative is dependent upon many factors like strong Program governance, availability of the trained resource, financial planning, targeted Implementation Team onboarding, focus on last-mile capacity building and ensuring necessary support to Urban center. Achievement of all these factors will provide the most effective and efficient roll-out and adoption of the Trade License System in the State.

Note: This document is specific for States that have more than 30 ULBs

TL implementation program is expected to be completed approximately between 38- 42 weeks with the resource deployment by the State and System Integrator (SI) Team (as defined below). However, it is critical that activities and exit criteria set for each stage are achieved to adhere to this timeline.

### Seven Stages of Implementation for Trade License

### Stage 0 - Program Setup/Onboarding

This is a set of initial critical activities undertaken on receiving a letter of Enrolment or MOU from the State. Successful completion of these activities assures that the program is started with crucial personnel, System Integrator (SI) Teams, and funds.
