## **Technical Implementation Details**

All the screen has been developed using the new-UI structure followed previously in FSM, PGR and PT, except for multi-component.

The link for the Apply Trade License Main Index is given below, it can be used to understand the starting point of the flow:

[https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/tl/src/pages/citizen/Create/index.js](https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/tl/src/pages/citizen/Create/index.js)

TL (Trade License) Module has been segregated into a specified structure, All the screen configuration is inside PageComponent Folder, and the configuration for routing of the pages are mentioned under config folder which is common for both Citizen as well as Employee. Below is the snippet for folder structure and routing configuration.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (265).png>)

```
export const newConfig = [
  {
    head: "",
    body: [
      {
        type: "component",
        component: "TLInfoLabel",
        key: "tradedetils1",
        withoutLabel: true,
        hideInCitizen: true,
      }
    ]
  },
```

Pages Folder is where the high-level configuration for controlling the whole flow is mentioned, for citizens and employees. Citizen includes Create, EditTrade, Renewal, Applications and Search Trade. Which inside carry the index (the main starting point of the whole flow).

In the Accessory-details page, Billing slab search API `"/tl-calculator/billingslab/_search"` is being called, which returns the array list of all the accessories for which the billing slab has been configured, from that object only a list of accessories has been formed, if the response came out to be an empty array then the options are curated from the MDMS API mentioned in the MDMS data section.

After completing the flow the user can download the acknowledgement PDF form of the License created and the config for the PDF generation can be found in the link given below:

[https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/tl/src/utils/getTLAcknowledgementData.js](https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/tl/src/utils/getTLAcknowledgementData.js)

Utils Folder basically contains all the methods which are being used throughout the TL module, and if any common method needs to be declared here, which in turn can be imported in other files.

For creating an Application the Create API from Trade License is being called using the React hooks, which has been declared under hooks/elements/TL as TLService.

## **MDMS Data**

Throughout the flow, a few of the page data are being imported from MDMS, Following is the list of pages that are using MDMS data, These pages .js files can be found under page components.

| PageComponent            | MDMS Detail                                                    | Module Details Name | Master-Detail Name    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| TradeLicense             | List of documents required for registration                    | `TradeLicense`      | `Documents`           |

| SelectVehicleType        | Type of mobility trade                                         | `common-masters`    | `StructureType`       |
| SelectBuildingType       | Type of Steady Trade                                           | `common-masters`    | `StructureType`       |
| SelectTradeUnits         | List of trade category and its corresponding type and sub-type | `TradeLicense`      | `TradeType`           |
| SelectAccessoriesDetails | Lit of Accessory and its Unit of measure and UOM value         | `TradeLicense`      | `AccessoriesCategory` |
| TLSelectAddress          | List of cities and its corresponding localities                | `TradeLicense`      | `tenants`             |
| SelectOwnerShipDetails   | categories imported are single and multiple owner.             | `common-masters`    | `OwnerShipCategory`   |
| SelectOwnerDetails       | List of Gender options.                                        | `common-masters`    | `GenderType`          |

For calling of MDMS data React Hooks has been used, so that it could be shared throughout the modules. Below is the little code snippet for the call used for MDMS.

```
const { isLoading, data: Documentsob = {} } = Digit.Hooks.tl.useTradeLicenseMDMS(stateId, "TradeLicense", "TLDocuments");
```

## **Localization**

Localization keys are added under the â€˜_rainmaker-tl_â€™ locale module. In future, if any new labels are implemented in the Trade License (Citizen) that should also be pushed in the locale DB under _rainmaker-tl_ locale module. Below is an example of few locale labels.
