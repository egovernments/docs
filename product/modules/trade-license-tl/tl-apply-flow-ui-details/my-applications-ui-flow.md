# My Applications UI Flow

## **My Applications** 

Users can review the list of applications and their status registered under their mobile number in the My Applications tab. Each Application for the initial view will display Application No, Service Category, Owner Name \(Multiple with a comma\), status, SLA, Trade Name with View Details option, and if the status is pending for payment it will be View Details & Pay, through which User can look up more details about the Application.

Once the user clicks on the View Details or View Details & Pay button, the Application Details Page will be displayed with all the necessary information about the application.

## **Technical Implementation Details**

The link for the Applications and Application Details main code is given below, it can be used to understand the working of the code, Below is the folder link.

[![](https://github.com/fluidicon.png)digit-ui-internals/packages/modules/tl/src/pages/citizen/Applications at main · egovernments/digit-ui-internals](https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/tree/main/packages/modules/tl/src/pages/citizen/Applications)

The template for My Application List is present under [https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/tl/src/pages/citizen/Applications/Application.js](https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/tl/src/pages/citizen/Applications/Application.js) and Application Details page is present inside [https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/tl/src/pages/citizen/Applications/ApplicationDetails.js](https://github.com/egovernments/digit-ui-internals/blob/main/packages/modules/tl/src/pages/citizen/Applications/ApplicationDetails.js) . 

All the Application list is being retrieved by calling the search API "`/tl-services/v1/_search`", if the view is set as “bills”, all the application is loaded using the hook `useFetchBill` which calls the `/billing-service/bill/v2/_fetchbill` API. SLA value in Application List Screen is being calculated from the data received from workflow API : `/egov-workflow-v2/egov-wf/process/_search`

Following is the hook used for the Trade search API.

```text
const { isLoading, isError, data, error, ...rest } = view === "bills" ? Digit.Hooks.tl.useFetchBill(
    {
      params: { businessService: "TL", tenantId, mobileNumber },
      config: { enabled: view === "bills" }
    }
  ) : Digit.Hooks.tl.useTLSearchApplication({}, {
    enabled: view !== "bills"
  });
```

To get the Application details in key-value format, in order to make it more compatible, following hook is being used, which is a common service to be used across modules.

```text
 const { isLoading, isError, error, data: application, error: errorApplication } = Digit.Hooks.tl.useTLApplicationDetails({
    tenantId: tenantId,
    applicationNumber: id,
  });
```

## **MDMS**

No MDMS data is being used here, all the data is being loaded from Search API/Fetch Bill API.

## **Localization**

For My Applications also the Localization keys are being added in the ‘_rainmaker-tl_’ locale module same as other parts of module TL. To change, update or of adding any new localization key will be done in the same locale module only.
