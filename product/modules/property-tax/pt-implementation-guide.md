(For details on product features refer to Section-2)

### Implementation Methodology for PT

For the offered product, the implementation process can be divided into seven major distinctive stages. Each stage has a predefined entry and exit criteria, roles & responsibilities to assure objective monitoring and decision making for the overall success of the engagement. The whole implementation lifecycle is typical of 38-42 weeks for the State, keeping in mind the entry, and exit criteria defined at the beginning and end of each stage are met on time recommended.

Stage Zero-program setup and onboarding is a pre-requisite for the initiative to kick-off and requires setup of the governance model, implementation Team and decision regarding other significant elements of the initiative like funding and procurement process. Stage One requires scoping of the initiative and decisions on the priorities for implementation by the State Implementation Team. In stage two, the State Team will work upon identifying and finding solutions to the significant gaps in the product offered with respect to the need of the State. Configuration and customization of the product offered is the primary objective of stage four. This involves working on various aspects of State-specific needs and incorporating them into the product offered. In stage five, post doing UAT and including all the necessary feedback on the product, the roll-out of the product is done at the State level (Go Live) from a couple of ULBs to pan State coverage in batches. Finally, in stage 6 sustenance and ongoing improvements are worked upon while the product is already functioning in the State. (For details on implementation plan refer to Section-3)

### Critical Success Factors for implementation

Implementation of Property Tax (PT) requires meticulous planning and close coordination between various stakeholders at the center and State level. The success of the initiative is dependent upon many factors like strong Program governance, availability of the trained resource, financial planning, targeted Implementation Team onboarding, focus on last-mile capacity building and ensuring necessary support to Urban center. Achievement of all these factors will provide the most effective and efficient roll-out and adoption of the Property Tax System in the State.

## Property Tax (PT) Implementation Methodology

This section provides an overview of the methodology for State-wide implementation of PT. The Implementation of PT is distributed across seven distinct stages. Each stage has a predefined entry & exit criteria and roles & responsibilities. This is to ensure objective monitoring and decision making for the overall success of the program. Details of each stage are defined in this section.

Note: This document is specific for States that have more than 30 ULBs

PT implementation program is expected to be completed approximately between 38- 42 weeks depending on the variety in Processes, Integration and the Disparate legacy data systems involved. This is done with the resource deployment by the State and System Integrator (SI) Team. However, it is critical that activities and exit criteria set for each stage are achieved to adhere to this timeline.

### Seven Stages of Implementation

### Stage 0 - Program Setup/Onboarding

This is a set of initial critical activities undertaken on receiving a letter of Enrollment or MOU from the State. Successful completion of these activities assures that the program is started with crucial personnel, System Integrator(SI) Teams, and funds.

### System Integrator(SI) Sign-up

* System Integrator and state will agree on program scope, program timelines, and budgeting & resourcing.

### Stage 1 - Program Kick-Off

This stage envisages in-person interaction of crucial State officials and implementation System Integrator(SI) Teams to kick-start the program. This stage may require multiple interactions/meetings with different interest groups. The principal objective of these interactions is to identify and agree on the scope and exclusions of Pilot ULBs, create an active collaboration & Governance approach and agree on a high-level timeline for the engagement.

### Stage 5 – Rollout

On successful Go-Live in the Pilot ULBs, and further fine tuning to stabilize the product, the solution will be rolled out to the rest of the ULBs in phases. Guidance and support from the State Team will be required to create the rollout plans and assure the necessary infrastructure for training and deployment is available at each ULB.

Note: The rollout phase needs to be detailed out for iterative activities of onboarding ULBs in batches.

Note: Only once all the stages are complete in one batch of rollout of around 30 ULBs, the next batch begins. There are multiple phases of rollout. The second batch begins after the first batch has successfully fulfilled all the criteria of the Rollout Phase. Typical timeline for closure of rollout in each batch is 5-6 weeks (in a batch of 30 ULBs)

### Stage 6 – Sustenance and Ongoing Improvement

The final stage consists of strategies to ensure the sustenance of the program in the State. Systems are put in place to ensure the continuous tracking of data and provisions are made to improve the product if new data suggests.

| ----------- |
| **PROGRAM** |

Vision:

Defining the time frame to go live, the time frame to scale it pan state, the value proposition of the programme for the state and year-on-year financial targets and adoption targets

Project Plan:

A detailed plan of Program schedule/timelines, implementation phases, team structure and ongoing support and maintenance required.

System Integrator:

The Entity/Company which collates all the subsystem required for the project and integrates them to achieve the program objective

Program Charter:

Outline of implementation plan agreement with priority applications and broad timelines, program governance model, program success metrics and capacity building.

Acceptance Letter/MOU:

Formal Acceptance/Sign Off of the Client State with a clear mandate of the Program

Program Success Metrics:

Defining the parameters (which are measurable) prior to the program, on which the success of the program is to be measured on the completion of the program

Project steering committee:

The key body within the governance structure which is responsible for the business issues associated with the project that are essential in ensuring the delivery of the project outputs and the attainment of project outcomes.

Project governance:

Set of policies, regulations, functions, processes, procedures and responsibilities that define the establishment, management and control of projects, programmes and portfolios.

Scoping:

List of activities measured against time taken to complete them in accordance with the project goals

Baseline data:

Set of information that serves as a foundation to compare other data acquired afterwards

Project Kick off meeting:

Meeting with the project team and the client of the project. This meeting would follow definition of the base elements for the project and other project planning activities

Fitment Study:

GAP Study of the Existing/Required Field Process Vs Product

Data migration:

Existing Records of the functional activities need to be moved into the Database of the newly released Application

Data collection:

Required data for the roll-out of the applications, which needs to be collected from the existing functional process

Data validation approach:

This approach enables the sanctity of the Data with built-in validation by Design

Data synchronization:

The process of establishing consistency among data from a source to a target data storage and vice versa and the continuous harmonization of the data over time.

Pilot Implementation:

Any new process is tested out as pilot in one or two instances before pan implementation

Pilot ULB:

The ULB's Selected for the pilot implementation are called pilot ULB’s.

Roll out:

On successful clearance of the Pilot, the Process/Application/Services are implemented across all Offices/ULB's

Deployment:

Deployment defines the complete package of Software components set up in a particular environment

Customisation:

Details of changes to be made in the Product to comply with the needed field process

Configuration:

Defining existing content such as Options and Variables based on the requirements on the ground

Product walkthrough:

Explaining the users step-by-step through a set of actions that they need to take to achieve a specific outcome
