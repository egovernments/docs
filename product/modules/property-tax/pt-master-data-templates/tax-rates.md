# Tax Rates

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Taxes are calculated based on the type of property and differ for each type.

For example, a residential property could have a different rate than a non-residential property, which could differ from year to year.

The tax could be a general property tax or a new type of tax introduced.
