# Unit Rates

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Unit rates are also an important part of property tax. The property tax for a property is calculated on the area covered by the property. These unit rates could differ from ULB to ULB, Ward to Ward, Mohalla to Mohalla and then can be based on different parameters such as Road Type, Property Construction Type etc.

### Steps to fill the data <a href="#steps-to-fill-the-data" id="steps-to-fill-the-data"></a>

1. Download the data template attached to this page.
2. Get a good understanding of all the headers in the template sheet, their data type, size, and definitions by referring to the ‘Data Definition’ section of this document.
3. In case of any doubt, please reach out to the person who has shared this template with you to discuss and clear your doubts.
4. Figure out on what boundary types are the property tax unit rates being defined and start filling that with its code and its name in English in the boundary code and boundary code name column.
5. In case there are more parameters on which the unit rates are being classified such as road type, construction type is being classified, start making a different column for the same starting from parameter 1, parameter 2…
6. Make sure you replace the column name from parameter 1 to the classification on which it is being classified.
7. At the end fill up the unit rates column.
8. Verify the data once again by going through the checklist and making sure that each and every point mentioned in the checklist is covered.

## Checklist <a href="#checklist" id="checklist"></a>
