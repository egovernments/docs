# Usage Category Minor

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Usage Category Minor is nothing but a further classification of [Usage Category Major](usage-category-major.md), which can be explained as a broad diversification of the usage of your property.

This broad diversification is ideally used to classify the tax amount to which a property could be exempted from.
