### Integration <a href="#integration" id="integration"></a>

### Integration Scope

The eChallan service is used to generate **e-challans / bill** for all miscellaneous / adhoc services which citizens avail from ULBs.

### Integration Benefits

* Can perform service-specific business logic without impacting the other module.
* Provides the capability of capturing the unique identifier of the entity for which the challan is generated.
* In the future, if we want to expose the application to citizen then it can be done easily.
* Workflow or Service-specific workflow can be enabled at the challan service level at any time without changing the design.
* Allow an employee to update / cancel challan

### Steps to Integration

1. To integrate, host of echallan-services module should be overwritten in helm chart.
2. echallan-services/eChallan/v1/\_create should be added as the create endpoint for creating eChallan in the system
3. echallan-services/eChallan/v1/\_search should be added as the search endpoint. This method handles all requests to search existing records depending on different search criteria
4. echallan-services/eChallan/v1/\_update should be added as the update endpoint. This method is used to update fields in existing records or to update the status of the application based on workflow.
