# Workflow Services

### Overview

Workflows are a series of steps that moves a process from one state to another state by actions performed by different kind of Actors - Humans, Machines, Time based events etc. to achieve a goal like onboarding an employee, or approve an application or grant a resource etc. The _egov-workflow-v2_ is a workflow engine which helps in performing these operations seamlessly using a predefined configuration.

### Pre-requisites

Before you proceed with the documentation, make sure the following pre-requisites are met -

* Java 8
* Kafka server is up and running
* egov-persister service is running and has workflow persister config path added in it
* PSQL server is running and database is created to store workflow configuration and data

### Key Functionalities

* Always allow anyone with a role in the workflow state machine to view the workflow instances and comment on it
* On the creation of workflow, it will appear in the inbox of all employees that have roles that can perform any state transitioning actions in this state.
* Once an instance is marked to an individual employee it will appear only in that employee's inbox although point 1 will still hold true and all others participating in the workflow can still search it and act if they have necessary action available to them
* If the instance is marked to a person who cannot perform any state transitioning action, they can still comment/upload and mark to anyone else.
* **Overall SLA:** SLA for the complete processing of the application/Entity
* **State-level SLA:** SLA for a particular state in the workflow

### Deployment Details

1. Deploy the latest version of egov-workflow-v2 service
2. Add businessService persister yaml path in persister configuration
3. Add Role-Action mapping for BusinessService API’s
4. Overwrite the egov.wf.statelevel flag ( _true_ for state level and _false_ for tenant level)
5. Create businessService (workflow configuration) according to product requirements
6. Add Role-Action mapping for _/processInstance/\_search_ API
7. Add workflow persister yaml path in persister configuration

### Configuration Details

For Configuration details please refer to the links in Reference Docs

### Integration Details

#### Integration Scope

The workflow configuration can be used by any module which performs a sequence of operations on an application/Entity. It can be used to simulate and track processes in organisations to make it more efficient too and increase accountability.

#### Integration Benefits

* Role-based workflow
* An easy way of writing rule
* File movement within workflow roles

#### Steps to Integration

1. To integrate, host of egov-workflow-v2 should be overwritten in helm chart
2. /process/\_search should be added as the search endpoint for searching workflow process Instance object.
3. /process/\_transition should be added to perform an action on an application. _(It’s for internal use in modules and should not be added in Role-Action mapping)_
4. The workflow configuration can be fetched by calling _\_search_ API to check if data can be updated or not in the current state
