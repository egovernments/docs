# Appropriation Service

## Overview

Apportion service is used to apportion the amount paid against a bill among the different tax heads based on the implemented algorithm. The default algorithm uses order of the tax head to apportion, the tax head with lowest order is apportioned off first while the highest order tax head is apportioned last.

## Pre-requisites

Before you proceed with the documentation, make sure the following pre-requisites are met -

* _Java 8_
* Kafka server is up and running
* egov-persister service is running and has apportion persister config path added in it
* PSQL server is running and database is created to store apportion audit data

## Key Functionalities

* Apportion payment in tax heads of bill
* Apportion advance amount in tax heads of demand during demand creation
