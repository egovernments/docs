**Localization format for SMS/Email**

```
{
     "code": "unique key referred for sms or email",
     "message": "sms value or email to be received",
     "module": "rainmaker-<modulename>",
     "locale": "<language key>"
  }
```

**Sample of SMS localisation for Trade License application initiation**\
**English localization**

```
{
  "code": "tl.en.counter.initiate",
  "message": "Dear <1>, Your Trade License application number for <2> has been generated. Your application no. is <3> You can use this application number to know your application status. Thank You. NagarSewa.",
  "module": "rainmaker-tl",
  "locale": "en_IN"
}
```

**Hindi localization**

```
{
  "code": "tl.en.counter.initiate",
  "message": "प्रिय <1>, <2> के व्यापार लाइसेंस के आवेदन के लिए आपका व्यापार लाइसेंस आवेदन संख्या <3> है। आप इस आवेदन संख्या का उपयोग अपनी आवेदन स्थिति जानने के लिए कर सकते हैं। धन्यवाद। नगरसेवा।",
  "module": "rainmaker-tl",
  "locale": "hi_IN"
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The placeholder <1>,<2>,<3> will the replaced by the actual required value which gives important information to the applicant.\
For example\*\*,\*\* the message will be received by the applicant as:\
Dear Kamal, Your Trade License application number for Ramjhula Provisional Store has been generated. Your application no. is UK-TL-2020-07-10-002058 You can use this application number….
{% endhint %}

The default language for SMS and Email can be set by

* Clicking on the preferred language from the available language button, in language selection page, which opens before the login page.
* In Citizen or Employee inbox page, the language can be selected from the drop-down, which can be seen in the right corner of the inbox title bar.
* If the language is not chosen by Citizen or Employee, then SMS/Email is received in default configured language. For example in a State if Hindi, English, Kannada are added as three languages in the system and out of these three languages if State decides that Kannada should be configured as default language then Kannada is set as the default language in MDMS. So when end-user does not choose any language then SMS/Email is sent in Kannada language.

The selected language key is sent as a parameter along with other required transaction parameters to the back end code.

In the back end, to send SMS/Email logic, language key is checked and based on the language key and SMS unique key, the message is fetched from the database.
