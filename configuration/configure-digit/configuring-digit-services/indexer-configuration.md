# Indexer Configuration

Indexer uses a config file per module to store all the configurations pertaining to that module. Indexer reads multiple such files at start-up to support indexing for all the configured modules. In config we define source and, destination elastic search index name, custom mappings for data transformation and mappings for data enrichment. Below is the sample configuration for indexing TL application creation data into elastic search.

| id                 | Takes comma-separated JsonPaths. The JSONPath is applied on the record received on the queue, the values hence obtained are appended and used as ID for the record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| isBulk             | Boolean key to identify whether the JSON received on the Queue is from a Bulk API.

| customJsonMapping  | Key to be used while building an entirely different object using the input JSON on the queue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| indexMapping       | A skeleton/mapping of the JSON that is to be indexed. Note that, this JSON must always contain a key called "Data" at the top-level and the custom mapping begins within this key. This is only a convention to smoothen dashboarding on Kibana when data from multiple indexes have to be fetched for a single dashboard.                                                                                                                             |
| fieldMapping       | Contains a list of configurations. Each configuration contains keys to identify the field of the input JSON that has to be mapped to the fields of the index json which is mentioned in the key 'indexMapping' in the config.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
