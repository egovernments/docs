# Types Of Reports Used In Report Service

### Overview <a href="#overview" id="overview"></a>

Configuring Report for a module requires adding the required report configuration as per the standard format and with the minimum development time.

UI can have different types of filters such as date, dropdown etc.. and even the sum of a column can also be easily displayed in UI. Pagination and downloading the report in pdf format, xls format is already present in the report UI.

Type of Reports which can be configured :

1. Count of applications
2. Statewide collections
3. Application status
4. Cancelled receipts
5. Migrated records / Data entry records

Limitation of this framework is for reports having requirements with complex queries with multiple joins as the report uses the query to fetch the data from the database, It is resource-intensive and response might be slow in those scenarios.
