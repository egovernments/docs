# Service Category

### Introduction

Service Category is a comprehensive list of services existing for the specific State/ULB. Service Category basically defines the miscellaneous revenue collection heads. Example - Rental, Entry Fees, User Charges etc.

Service categories are defined at a global level for different types of revenues. Payment collection and processing for certain services like property tax and trade licenses are done through the individual modules. The mCollect module processes payments for other miscellaneous services.

The Service Category masters list allows States/ULBs to identify the miscellaneous services for which payments and collections can be processed.
