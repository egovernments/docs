# Localization

### Introduction

Localization is a practice to localize various UI visible data into the local wordings according to the client's requirements. This practice of localization is enforced to various clients so that it becomes easier for the people using the service to understand the common terminology and make the best use of the available system.

The following texts \(but not limited to\) on the web page can be localized:

1. Labels
2. Messages: Alert messages, success messages, validation messages and other notifications etc.
3. Help Texts

{% hint style="info" %}
The module-specific master data would already have been made available in the localized form while collecting the data for the respective module-specific configuration.
{% endhint %}
