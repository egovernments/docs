# Google Map Configuration

### Introduction

At times in the different modules, there is a need to capture the address of the user’s place of residence or where the person is doing a trade, for which the user has to enter his/her full address which creates a task. In order to simplify the process, we can have google map geolocation service in place which would help us get the exact coordinates of the place on the map and help us identify the place.

This service is paid and the client has to purchase the below items:
