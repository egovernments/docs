# Building Occupancy

### Introduction

Building Occupancy classifications help in categorizing structures based on the proposed use of the building. Occupancy categories determine the required permits and approvals. The Building Occupancy types data is hence a vital parameter used to define approval workflows in the OBPS module. Refer to the [National Bye-Laws](http://mohua.gov.in/upload/uploadfiles/files/Chap-4.pdf) to view the prescribed list of occupancy types.
