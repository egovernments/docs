| Sr No | Column Name | Data Type | Data Size | Is Mandatory? | Definition/ Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Name | Text | 250 | Yes | To indicate the Function name, User can select a particular function code while recording a transaction in the system. This will facilitate in generating a report at the function level |
| 2 | Code | Alphanumeric | 50 | Yes | The unique code is given to the individual function. Child functions have to follow number pattern starting with the parent code |
| 3 | Level | Numeric | 50 | Yes | As per NMAM, the Function can be defined in the tree structure, so the Level indicates the structure in which the function would be setup. Root nodes will be level 0 and the next level funds will have value as 1 and the next level as value 2 |
| 4 | Parent Type | Text | 250 | No | If the ULB’s using multiple Functions then a Hierarchy of “Parent-Child “can be set up for the Function, so under each Parent Function a multiple child function can be set up |
| 5 | Parent Code | Alphanumeric | 50 | No | The unique code representing the parent type function |
